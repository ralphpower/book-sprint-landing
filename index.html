        <h2 class="about-title">Hi, I'm Ralph Kapiamba</h2>
        <p class="about-text">I'm a book coach and publisher who specializes in helping busy South African professionals turn their expertise into published books that build authority and create new opportunities.</p>
        <p class="about-text">I've worked with executives, entrepreneurs, and consultants who had brilliant ideas locked in their heads but couldn't figure out how to get them onto paper - especially while managing demanding careers and South African realities like load shedding.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- 6. Outline your journey -->
    <div class="journey-section">
        <h2 class="journey-title">How I Discovered This Method</h2>
        <p class="journey-text">After watching countless smart professionals struggle for years to write their books, I realized the problem wasn't lack of knowledge or writing ability - it was lack of a systematic approach that worked within their busy lives.</p>
        <p class="journey-text">I developed the 30-Day Book Sprint Method by reverse-engineering what actually worked for my most successful clients. No more "someday I'll write my book" - this is about getting it done in 30 days while managing your career, family, and even load shedding.</p>
        <p class="journey-text">Since then, I've helped dozens of professionals become published authors, with some using their books to attract R200,000+ in new business and speaking opportunities.</p>
